Welcome to the Real-Time Waste Recognition System! This project utilizes Streamlit and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify waste items into organic and recyclable categories based on uploaded images. User data is stored in JSON format for real-time database management.

Features
Image Upload Classification: Upload an image of a waste item through the Streamlit interface to classify it as organic or recyclable using the CNN model.

Real-Time Database: User data, including uploaded images and classification results, are stored and managed in real-time using JSON format.

Interactive Interface: User-friendly web application powered by Streamlit for seamless interaction and immediate classification feedback.

How It Works
Upload Mode: Open the Streamlit app, upload an image of a waste item, and click 'Upload' to initiate classification.

Classification: The CNN model processes the uploaded image to determine if the waste item is organic or recyclable.

# Real-Time Database Management:
User data, including uploaded images and classification results, are stored in JSON format for real-time accessibility and management.
